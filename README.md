# Mass Detection in Medical Images

This project implements a deep learning model for detecting mass regions in medical images using the EfficientDet architecture. It uses 512x512 JPEG images converted from DICOM files and is designed to assist in medical diagnostics.

## Features
- EfficientDet D0 architecture
- Supports object detection with bounding boxes
- Augmentation techniques: random flip, scaling, cropping, padding
- Pre-trained model fine-tuning
